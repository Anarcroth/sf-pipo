# SFPIPO

Simple File Ping-Pong: a web server used to ping-pong a couple of files.

---

Problem to solve: I often get into a situation where I need to send myself some files and none of the technologies I have around me really do what I want them to do. They are either too clunky, or not fast enough, or would get backed up with a lot of redundant junk. Can't use Slack or Skype, because I will just backup all of my history with files and it will get confusing. Cant' use Google Drive, because Google is evil. If I use a flash drive, I'll just forget it somewhere. Can't setup a home server, because the damn ISP doesn't want to cooperate with me.

What I really needed is some remote storage, where I can upload/download files, the ones I need to share with myself, in an easy and fast fashion. This is the real purpose of SFPIPO - to ping-pong myself files on a day-to-day basis.

### Running

**Remote**

It's very simple to setup this project for yourself. All you need is to either have a hosting provider that can run Clojure (such as Heroku), or have your own server where you can deploy the app for yourself.

Heroku has a [simple tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-clojure) on how to deploy your app to them.

**Localhost (or self-host)**

To run the app locally is as simple as

``` bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/Anarcroth/sfpipo.git

# move to project dir
cd sfpipo

# run with leiningen
lein run
```

Alternatively, you can build yourself an uberjar and run it with Java.

``` bash
# create uberjar
lein uberjar

# run
java $JVM_OPTS -cp target/sfpipo.jar clojure.main -m sfpipo.core
```

### Usage

Using sfpipo is very easy. Just throw `curl` at it. This allows you to quickly and painlessly upload/get files from your remote. No GUI, no clicking, no nothing.

Currently, the server supports:

* Getting files.
``` bash
# Get file from server
curl -u username:password -XGET "https://<your address>/file/<filename>" -o <filename>
```

* Uploading files.
``` bash
# Upload file to server
curl -u username:password -XPOST "https://<your address>/upload" -F file=@<yourfile>
```

* Deleting files.
``` bash
# Delete file from server
curl -u username:password -XDELETE "https://<your address>/file/<filename>"
```

* Listing uploaded files.
``` bash
# List uploaded files to server
curl -u username:password -XGET "https://<your address>/list-files"
```

**NOTE:** What you are seeing in the examples is **not secure**. For sending credentials over curl, check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2594880/using-curl-with-a-username-and-password) out.

### Security

SFPIPO **is not secure**. If you upload something over `http` or upload a file that has sensitive data, **you should be responsible for managing the safety of that data**.

If you want to upload data that is secured, then encrypt the data beforehand with `gpg` or something else. If you upload encrypted information, even if it gets stolen, [cracking gpg](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/77340/how-easy-is-it-to-crack-gpg-with-private-key-but-without-password) is a challenge on its own, so don't worry it will get compromised.

**WARNING NOTE:** If you use a remote service, like Heroku, then people who know the address of your app **can** get your files. The risks are smaller for this if you have a self-host, but keep in mind that **currently**, there is no _legitimate_ authentication on sfpipo.

The authentication that is used now in sfpipo is the following: Each time the app is deployed, a random username and password are generated, thus you'll be able to see these things in the first lines of the initial log. These are the credentials to authenticate against. The problem here is that sending creds over curl is a [very bad idea](https://superuser.com/questions/919859/is-curl-u-usernamepassword-http-example-com-secure). There are ways around it, but _future work_ must be done to make the connection to the server more secure.
